    "## Van Hove Function Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will go over the calculation of the Van Hove Function (VHF) using the `scattering` package.  The VHF is defined as the time-dependent radial distribution function (RDF), $G(r, t)$ where $r$ is distance and $t$ is time.  That is, the probability of finding particle $j$ at $t=t$ at a distance $r$ from the position of particle $i$ at $t=0$.  The VHF analysis is useful as we can study the correlations between particles over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The VHF is defined as the following for fluids containing monotonic atoms:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "     G(r,t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\rho N r^2}\\sum_{i, j} \\delta(r - |\\boldsymbol{r_i    }(0) - \\boldsymbol{r_j}(t)|)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\rho$ is the average number density of atoms, $N$ is the number of atoms in the system, $r_j(t)$ is the position of the $j$th atom at time $t$ and $\\delta(r)$ is the Dirac delta function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For fluids of polyatomic molecules, the VHF is computed as a summation of the VHFs between atoms $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, which are referred to the partial VHFs.  This equation for a partial VHF is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    " G_{\\alpha\\beta}(r,t)  = \\frac{V}{4\\pi N_\\alpha N_\\beta r^2}\n",
    "\\sum_{i\\in\\{\\alpha\\}}\\sum_{i\\in\\{\\beta\\}} \\delta(r - |\\boldsymbol{r_i}(0    ) -\n",
    " \\boldsymbol{r_j}(t)|)\n",
    " \\end{equation}\n",
    " \n",
    " The total VHF for a fluid computed from the partial VHFs is then defined as:\n",
    " \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\begin{gathered}\n",
    "G(r,t) = \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{N_\\alpha} \\sum_{\\beta=1}^{N_\\beta} x_{\\alpha}     x_{\\beta} \\bar{b}_{\\alpha} \\bar{b}_{\\beta}G_{\\alpha\\beta}(r,t) \\\\\n",
    "\\end{gathered}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x_{\\beta}$ is the atomic fraction for species $\\beta$,and $\\bar{b}_{\\alpha}$ is the form factor proportional to the number of electrons in species $\\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The 'scattering' package\n",
    "`scattering` uses `MDTraj` as the backend to load in simulation trajectories for computing the VHF.  There are two main functions for computing the VHF.  Distance calculations are computed with underlying C++ code for computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The partial VHF for two species can be computed with the function `van_hove.compute_partial_van_hove`.  The total VHF for a polyatomic fluid can be computed with the function `van_hove.compute_van_hove`.  This tutorial will cover both functions below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation Instructions\n",
    "`scattering` requires the following packages:\n",
    "- numpy\n",
    "- mdtrj\n",
    "- scipy\n",
    "- progressbar2\n",
    "- cython\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of creating this notebook, the distance calculations for the VHF have not been officially released in MDTraj through Conda.  As a result, MDTraj will need to be installed from source on GitHub.  The following steps are recommended to get a minimum working environment for this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `conda create -n vhf python=3.7`\n",
    "- `conda install -c conda-forge -c anaconda numpy scipy jupyter progessbar2 cython`\n",
    "- `git clone https://github.com/mdtraj/mdtraj` Note: It's recommended this repository is installed in a separate directory to keep track of versions specific to this tutorial.\n",
    "- `cd mdtraj` and `pip install -e .`\n",
    "- `cd ..` (cd out of the `mdtraj` repository)\n",
    "- `git clone https://github.com/mattwthompson/scattering.git`\n",
    "- `cd scattering` and `pip install -e .`"
